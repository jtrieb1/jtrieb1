- Hi, I'm Jacob.
- I'm interested in mathematics, low-level computation, games, and emulation.
- I tend to work primarily with low-level languages like Rust, C, and C++, but I do have experience in
  higher level languages like JS, TS, C#, Haskell, Idris, and Agda.
- I recently acquired books on Fortran 90 and COBOL, so they'll likely make an appearance soon.
- I also have an affinity for more... unique languages. APL, Whitespace, Ook, Befunge, INTERCAL. The weird stuff.
- You can reach me at jacob.triebwasser@gmail.com, but know that I may be slow to reply due to my work obligations coming first.
