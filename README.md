- Hi, I'm Jacob Triebwasser
- I'm interested in mathematics, low-level computation, games, and emulation.
- I'm currently learning Rust, but have a good grasp on JS, TS, Python, C, C++, C#, Haskell, and to a lesser extent Idris.
- I'm not currently looking to collaborate, but that may change in the future.
- You can reach me at jacob.triebwasser@gmail.com, but know that I may be slow to reply due to my work obligations coming first.
